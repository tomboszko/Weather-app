## Issues

It seems not finished, I tried to add a chart view, but due to the lack of time... I decided to not show it.

I have an issue with the forecasting: first day of the 5's is the same that the current day of temp --> I will find a way to fix it later.

Main issue: keeping my API secret : I tried many way with dotenv, but too much struggles, so my API token for this project is "cadeau".

I didn't try "Unspalsh" I will when this readme will be done.

## Feedback

It was really interesting to work with API, it's not so complicated and very useful.

I had some struggles to manage front and back side, so I decided to put all my focus on backend first.

then,

When all was working in a good way, I put some style, without framework, pure css.
I become more "habitu√©" with the styling side, this project reveal that I'm interesting in fullstack dev.

THis kind of project can be in my portfolio, but must be enhanced first, so, wait and see...
